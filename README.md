# WCM_SVWC
This repository is an official implementation of object detectors used in the paper "Role of Sensing and Computer Vision in 6G Wireless Communications".

# Methods
By running detr.py in DETR folder, we can detect humans and cell phones in the RGB images using DETR.

By running inference.py in EfficientDet folder, we can detect humans and cell phones in the RGB images using EfficientDet.

To evaluate the object detection results, run calc_metric.py.

The codes have been tested on torch2.2.1+cuda11.8.

# Preparation
Please download the dataset from drive.google.com.
